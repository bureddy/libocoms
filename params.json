It provides\r\ncomponents and functionality to build the modular component architecture (MCA) based \r\nnetwork libraries. The code is based on Open MPI's subproject Open Portability \r\nAbstraction Layer (OPAL). The OCOMS library provides the same functionality as \r\nOPAL while providing the ability to be integrated with other network libraries. \r\nMore details can be found here: http://www.open-mpi.org/doc/\r\n\r\n1.
